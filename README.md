# VTOL-VR-Radio-Shuffle
Easy to use radio shuffle for VTOL VR with an option for the process automation!


# Description
With this you can shuffle your radio songs with ease, and even make the process automatical.

# Installation
All you need to do is to unzip the zip file into the RadioMusic folder in your VTOL VR directory.

It should look something like this:
steamapps/common/VTOL VR/RadioMusic/VTOL-VR Radio Shuffle

That's pretty much it.

# Usage
There are two main options how to use it.

Manual: Open "VTOL-VR Radio Shuffle.exe". There you'll be met with a nice looking menu. I don't think it needs any deep explanations.

Semi-Auto: There's a second .exe file, named "VTOL-VR Auto Radio Shuffle.exe". It's used for the automatic shuffle that will be configurated in the manual .exe file, but technically you can use this file for shuffle too.

# Process Automation
To fully automate the process, you need to open the manual .exe file, and choose the forth option, which is "Automate Process". There you'll be asked to enter VTOL VR path. Just give the path to the folder where the game's .exe file is. That's it.

# Code
Even though the code is open source, I REALLY don't recommend you looking at it. My task was to make it work. Not to make it look good. You might lose your faith in humanity if you didn't lose it already.
